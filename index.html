        Hi! this is a short blog post about some of the birds and Frogs
        in my backyard. I'll write a little description of each one.
        so you can learn a little about them.

          Alright, first up we've got the Norther Flicker! It's a type of
          woodpecker known for its distinctive spotted plumage and loud,
          ringing calls. They are often seen on the ground, where they forage
          for ants and other insects.

          Next, we have the Redwinged Blackbird! These birds are easily
          recognizable by the bright red and yellow patches on their wings.
          They are often found in wetlands and marshes, where they build their
          nests among the reeds. These ones have a very distinctive call.

          Here we have a Spotted Towhee! These birds are known for their striking
          red eyes and the black and white speckles on their wings. They are often
          found in dense shrubs and thickets, where they forage for insects and seeds.
